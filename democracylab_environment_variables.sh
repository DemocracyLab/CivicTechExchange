DemocracyLab launched a product that attempted to achieve that vision, but made mistakes now obvious with the benefit of hindsight, and built a platform that didn’t attract enough users to have a long-term impact.\n\nIn 2012, the organization pivoted to address the inefficiency of the tech-for-good sector, which we believe is caused in part by poor flows of information and allocation of resources. Our platform addresses these problems and helps tech-for-good projects attract the volunteer talent they need to launch, test their hypotheses and prove their concepts.\n\nMark spent 20 years working in the financial services industry as a financial advisor and 401(k) wholesaler. In 2016 he enrolled in graduate school at the University of Washington, where he earned MBA and MPA degrees.
