          <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a> is a
          global day of giving - please consider donating to one of the most
          full-featured, collaborative platforms for developing tech-for-good
          projects! Given these unprecedented times, your donation is now more

          #GivingTuesday was created back in 2012 by the team at the Belfer
          Center for Innovation & Social Impact at the 92nd Street Y-a cultural
          center in New York City and has, since then, become a global
          philanthropic movement. Last year, #GivingTuesday saw a significant
          increase in donations, growing from $177 million in online donations
          in 2016 to $511 Million in 2019.
